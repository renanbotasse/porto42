# 42 Piscine - Porto

42 School is a global education initiative that offers a unique and innovative approach to learning technology. Instead of traditional classrooms and teachers, students learn through peer-to-peer interaction. This method helps students develop computing and life skills, essential for becoming professionals in the tech industry.

To be admitted to 42, I had to go through a highly competitive selection process. The final stage of the selection process is called the "C Piscine," a 26-day C programming bootcamp that challenges my skills to the maximum.

I've been learning hard and soft skills during the C Piscine. This includes C programming, where I work with variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros, and libraries. I've also learned shell commands and how to use Git to submit my projects.

Here, you can find all the subjects and my answers. I won't claim that every exercise is correct; you must assess them yourself. However, there is still a clear path to follow for the program.
