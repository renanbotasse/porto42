# 42 School
<p align="justify">
42 School is a global education initiative that offers a unique and innovative approach to learning technology. Rather than traditional classrooms and teachers, the students learn through peer-to-peer. This method helps the students to develop both computing and life skills, which is essential for becoming a professional in the tech industry.

I'm a big believer in the power of sharing knowledge - it's something that we all should do as part of our basic obligation to society.

This repository is where I've stashed all the projects and information about the 42 Common Core. I'm still a 42 Student and this repository will be improved as I advance in the course.

I hope that by sharing my work and experiences, I can help out other students or anyone else who's interested in coding.

Thanks for checking out my repository, and I hope you find what you're looking for.

Here, you can find all the subjects and my answers. I won't claim that every exercise is correct; you must assess them yourself. However, there is still a clear path to follow for the program.

## [Common Core](https://github.com/renanbotasse/porto42/tree/main/commonCore42)
<p align="justify">
After successfully completing the Piscine, you'll be ready to dive into the Common Core, which serves as the core curriculum at 42. In this phase, you'll tackle significantly more intricate projects, which encompass: creating libraries, working with virtual machines, mastering terminal commands, developing a small 2D game using MiniLibx, implementing a shell, delving into networks and subnet masks, crafting a 3D 'game' with MiniLibx, building a web server from scratch in C++, getting acquainted with Docker and containerization, configuring a LEMP stack with Wordpress, replicating pipe functionality, solving the Philosopher's Dinner problem in C, and exploring threads, mutexes, processes, semaphores, and Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Furthermore, you'll receive an introduction to C++, including memory management, object-oriented programming (OOP), input/output and file streams, operator overloading, as well as templates/generics and containers.

When I joined 42, I was living in the Porto region. However, after the first few months of the Common Core, I had to move to a city more than 250 kilometres away from the 42 Campus. The trips took about 3 hours each way, meaning I had to wake up at 4:30 in the morning and wouldn't return until around 1:30 the next day. Additionally, the costs of these trips became hard to handle, making it impossible for me to continue in the program.

However, I'm not the type of person who easily gives up and abandons their goals. I decided to research and complete all the projects of the Common Core on my own. While my solutions were not validated by the 42 computers, they may still be helpful to other students who are studying the same material.
