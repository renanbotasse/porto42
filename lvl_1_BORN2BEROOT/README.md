# 1.TASK <a name="task"></a>
## 1.1 Introduction
<p align="justify">
The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with virtualization, where you will follow step-by-step instructions to create your first virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM if VirtualBox is unavailable. By the end of this project, you will have the ability to set up your operating system with stringent guidelines in place.
 </p>
 
## 1.2 Mandatory 
<p align="justify">
Although the project allows you to choose between Debian and Rocky, it is recommended that new system administrators opt for Debian. For this reason, we have selected Debian as the operating system for this project.

We must create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101360239/218792124-a2877ec7-6bd2-40e2-9f0d-4bed1120f247.png" width="600" height="300">
</p>
<p align="justify">
A SSH service will be running on port 4242 only. For security reasons, it must not be possible to connect using SSH as root.

We have to configure your operating system with the UFW firewall and thus leave only port 4242 open.

To meet the project requirements, we must ensure that the hostname of our virtual machine ends with 42 and matches our login (e.g., rb42). During evaluation, we will be required to modify this hostname. Additionally, we must implement a strong password policy, and install and configure sudo according to strict guidelines. Apart from the root user, we must create a user with our login as the username, and ensure that the user belongs to both the user42 and sudo groups.
</p>
To establish a robust password policy, we must adhere to the following criteria:
<p align="justify">
Passwords must expire every 30 days.
The minimum number of days before a password can be modified will be set to 2.
A warning message must be displayed to the user 7 days before their password expires.
Passwords must be at least 10 characters in length, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number, and must not have more than 3 consecutive identical characters.
Usernames must not be included in passwords.
The rule that requires the password to have at least 7 characters that are not part of the former password does not apply to the root password.
The root password must also comply with this policy.

To establish a robust configuration for the sudo group, we must comply with the following guidelines:

Sudo authentication attempts must be limited to 3 in case of an incorrect password.
A customized error message must be displayed in the event of an incorrect password when using sudo.
Each sudo action must be archived, including inputs and outputs, and the log file must be stored in the /var/log/sudo/ directory.
The TTY mode must be enabled to enhance security.
The paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted to improve security. For example: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin

As the final step, we need to create a bash script named "monitoring.sh." This script should display certain information on all terminals every 10 minutes (use "wall" for this purpose) during server startup. The banner can be added optionally, and no errors should be visible.
</p>
The following information must always be displayed by the script:
<p align="justify">
The architecture of the operating system and its kernel version
The number of physical processors
The number of virtual processors
The current available RAM on the server and its utilization rate as a percentage
The current available memory on the server and its utilization rate as a percentage
The current utilization rate of the processors as a percentage
The date and time of the last reboot
Whether LVM is active or not
The number of active connections
The number of users currently using the server
The IPv4 address of the server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address
The number of commands executed with the sudo program.
Here's an example of how the script is supposed to work:

# 2. PROJECT CONCEPT 

## 2.1 Virtual Machine
<p align="justify">
Virtual Machine (VM), is equal to a physical computer. It has CPU, RAM, HD and (usually) can connect to the internet. The only difference is VM work like a software computer, existing only as a code, running inside a physical server. You can have inside your computer a VM, you can run different operating systems (Linux/MAC/Windows), use a big server (like Azure) or your won computer. 
We named it "Virtual" because is a virtual version of a computer. Perhaps virtual, it has a dedicated amount of CPU, RAM and HD, "borrowed" from a physical host computer, normally a cloud provider's data center.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101360239/218759498-b6a5eb0e-05fa-41b5-b36c-72423eba7276.png" width="600" height="300">
</p>
</p>

## 2.2 How VM work
<p align="justify">
In minimal explanation, VM is a computer file. It is an image that behaves like an actual computer. 
You can run is a window "separate from the computer" or function as the user's entire computer
To be more clear one of the strongest points of VM is it is partitioned from the rest of the system, the software running inside can't interfere with the host computer operating system.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101360239/216980968-3070e086-2e0a-48d9-8204-db42dff297ef.png" width="600" height="300">
</p>
</p>

## 2.3 LVM
<p align="justify">
LVM is a form of storage virtualization that offers system administrators a more flexible approach to managing disk storage, this tool gives you the power to allocate disks, create, resize, delete and mirror your HD.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101360239/216986265-8c0e0ff9-79ca-40e5-80c7-3a08c91683b7.png" width="600" height="300">
</p>

But first, we need to understand 3 concepts in LVM: Volume Groups, Physical Volumes and Logical Volumes.
Volume Group is a named collection of physical and logical volumes, systems only need one Volume Group to contain the physical and logical volumes. 
Physical Volumes are the disks; block devices that provide the space to store logical volumes. 
Logical volumes are partitions, they hold a filesystem and get names rather than numbers, they can span across multiple disks, and they do not have to be physically contiguous. 
To be clear, if you have more than one HD, with the LVM you can extend "the size of the store" over more than one HD, they are not limited by the real size of each HD, the limit is the total aggregate size.
You also can create an image of any LV, and with that you can revert the original LV at a later time. This is very handy for backups.
</p>

## 2.4 AppArmor
<p align="justify">
App is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC). But what is a Mandatory Access Control? 
MAC is a method of limiting access to resources based on the sensitivity of the information.
You have to define the security label of your resource, this label goes from 0 to any level you need. This works because of the hierarchical classification of the resources, like an inverted pyramid. And you also can slice the levels, some information can be used by Group A or Group B.
Users can access only the information in a resource to which their security labels entitle them. If the user's security label does not have enough authority, the user cannot access the information in the resource.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101360239/217017358-0f1a59a0-e1c7-4181-a6bf-ccdd45add915.png" width="600" height="300">
</p>

So, AppArmor is a system of MAC for Linux, used to confine programs and limited resources from Users. 
AppArmor is so good because the confinement is provided via boot, and you can bind access control to programs rather than to users.
There are two profile modes: enforcement and complain. 
Profiles loaded in enforcement mode will result in enforcement of the policy defined in the profile as well as reporting policy violation attempts.
Profiles in complain mode will not enforce policy but instead report policy violation attempts.
The big difference from other MAC systems on Linux is the possibility of mixing enforcement and complain profiles.
</p>

## 2.5 Apt or Aptitude
<p align="justify">
APT stands for Advanced Packaging Tool, an open/source tool, designed to handle software installation and removal. 
It is a command-line tool with no visual reference from a graphical interface.
The word that rules APT is flexible. The user can configure how APT works, including adding new sources, providing up-gradation options, and more.
On the other side, Aptitude is close to API, but you have a graphical interface, you use to emulate most of the apt get's command line and you have flexible but less than APT.
API can be used for package up-gradation, installation, resolving dependencies, system up-gradation, and more. However, Aptitude is good to inclusion functionalities of apt-cache and apt-mark, having more functionality, including package search, setting package installation as automation or manual, and more refined actions on the packages.
</p>

## 2.6 SSH
<p align="justify">
SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate (c.f http or hypertext transfer protocol, which is the protocol used to transfer hypertext such as web pages) and share data. An inherent feature of ssh is that the communication between the two computers is encrypted meaning that it is suitable for use on insecure networks.
SSH is often used to "login" and perform operations on remote computers but it may also be used for transferring data.
SSH enables us to provide a service with encrypted access for the widest range of operating systems (Windows XP-10, Max OS X and Linux); this would not be possible if we provided Windows networked drives (which utilise the SMB/CIFS communication protocol). SSH is reliable and secure and is often used in the High Performance Computing community for this reason.

</p>

</p>

## 2.7 UFW with SSH
<p align="justify">
UFW stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. It is a command-line interface firewall configuration tool used in Linux systems to manage incoming and outgoing traffic. UFW is designed to make it easier for users to manage their firewall rules without requiring advanced knowledge of iptables
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet, to protect against unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Firewalls can be hardware devices, software programs, or a combination of both. They are a fundamental component of network security and help prevent data breaches, malware infections, and other cyber threats.
SSH and UFW are both related to network security on Linux systems. SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to establish a secure connection between two computers, typically for remote access or file transfers. UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a tool used to configure the firewall on a Linux system to restrict or allow network traffic.
When using SSH to connect to a remote Linux system, the connection is typically secured by the SSH protocol, which encrypts the data sent over the network. However, to further enhance the security of the system, it is recommended to configure the firewall using UFW to restrict access to the SSH port (usually port 22) to only trusted sources. This helps to prevent unauthorized access attempts to the system and reduces the risk of successful attacks. Therefore, using UFW in conjunction with SSH can help to create a more secure network environment on a Linux system

</p>


</p>

## 2.8 Cron and Wall
<p align="justify">
Cron is a job scheduler. It allows users to schedule tasks or commands to run automatically at specified intervals. These scheduled tasks are known as "cron jobs". 
Cron is often used to automate system maintenance tasks, such as backups or updates, and to perform periodic tasks like sending emails or generating reports. 
And "wall" is a command used to send a message to all logged-in users on a Linux system. It stands for "write all" and broadcasts a message to all active terminals or TTYs.
The "wall" command is often used in combination with cron to notify users of important events or scheduled maintenance tasks. For example, a system administrator might set up a cron job to run a backup script and then use the "wall" command to notify all users that the backup is in progress and that the system may be temporarily unavailable.
The message sent using the "wall" command is typically displayed as a full-screen message, and it can be an effective way to communicate with users who are currently logged in to the system. 

cd /usr/local/bin â€“ to show monitoring.sh
sudo crontab -u root -e â€“ to edit the cron job
change script to */1 * * * * sleep 30s && script path â€“ to run it every 30 seconds, delete the line to stop the job from running.

</p>
</p>

## 2.9 Sudo
<p align="justify">
Sudo or "superuser do" is a command-line utility that allows users to execute commands with the privileges of another user, typically the root user. It is often used to perform administrative tasks that require elevated privileges, such as installing software or modifying system settings.
The use of sudo helps to prevent unauthorized access to the root account, which is a powerful account that can make system-wide changes. Instead of logging in as the root user, which can be dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible, users can use the sudo command to temporarily elevate their privileges and perform the necessary tasks.

</p>

</p>

## 2.10 Script
<p align="justify">
A script is a program written in a scripting language that can be executed by an interpreter or a command-line interface. Scripts are typically used to automate tasks or perform repetitive actions, such as file manipulation, system administration, or data processing.
Scripts can be executed manually from a command-line interface or scheduled to run automatically at specific intervals using tools such as cron. They can also be integrated with other programs or systems using APIs or other interfaces, making them versatile and powerful tools for automating tasks and improving productivity.

## 2.11 Rocky or Debian
<p align="justify">
Rocky and Debian are high-quality Linux distributions, but they have different strengths and target audiences. Debian is stable and with a long history, while Rocky is a newer design for users who prefer a rolling release model and are familiar with the Red Hat/CentOS ecosystem.

</p>

## 2.12 TTY
<p align="justify">
Teletype refers to a physical or virtual terminal device used to interact with the system.

This script is a Bash script that is used to collect various system information and display it on the terminal or the console. Here's an explanation of the different parts of the script:

The first line starts with a shebang #!/bin/bash that tells the system to run the script using the Bash shell.
The script uses various commands to collect system information and stores the output of each command in a variable for further processing. For example:
arc=$(uname -a) gets the system's architecture information and stores it in the $arc variable.
pcpu=$(grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | sort | uniq | wc -l) gets the number of physical CPUs on the system and stores it in the $pcpu variable.
vcpu=$(grep "^processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l) gets the number of virtual CPUs on the system and stores it in the $vcpu variable.
fram=$(free -m | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}') gets the total amount of system memory and stores it in the $fram variable.
uram=$(free -m | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}') gets the used amount of system memory and stores it in the $uram variable.
pram=$(free | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf("%.2f"), $3/$2*100}') calculates the percentage of memory used and stores it in the $pram variable.
fdisk=$(df -BG | grep '^/dev/' | grep -v '/boot$' | awk '{ft += $2} END {print ft}') gets the total disk space available on the system and stores it in the $fdisk variable.
udisk=$(df -BM | grep '^/dev/' | grep -v '/boot$' | awk '{ut += $3} END {print ut}') gets the used disk space on the system and stores it in the $udisk variable.
pdisk=$(df -BM | grep '^/dev/' | grep -v '/boot$' | awk '{ut += $3} {ft+= $2} END {printf("%d"), ut/ft*100}') calculates the percentage of disk space used and stores it in the $pdisk variable.
cpul=$(top -bn1 | grep '^%Cpu' | cut -c 9- | xargs | awk '{printf("%.1f%%"), $1 + $3}') gets the CPU usage and stores it in the $cpul variable.
lb=$(who -b | awk '$1 == "system" {print $3 " " $4}') gets the date and time when the system was last booted and stores it in the $lb variable.

Not connect using SSH as root (sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
It is generally recommended to disable direct root login via SSH for security reasons. Instead, you can log in with a regular user account and then use "sudo" to execute administrative commands.

To disable direct root login via SSH in Linux, you can follow these steps:

Connect to your server using SSH with your regular user account.

Open the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file using a text editor with administrative privileges. For example, you can use the following command to open the file with "sudo" and "nano":

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Find the line in the file that begins with "PermitRootLogin". If the value is set to "yes", change it to "no". For example:

perl
Copy code
PermitRootLogin no
Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.

Restart the SSH service to apply the changes. For example, you can use the following command to restart the service:

Copy code
sudo service ssh restart
After completing these steps, you will no longer be able to connect to the server directly as the root user via SSH. Instead, you will need to log in with a regular user account and use "sudo" to execute administrative commands. This can help improve the security of your system by limiting the potential attack surface.

- Modify hostname (/etc/pam.d/common-password)
The file "/etc/pam.d/common-password" in Linux contains configuration for the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) system, which is used to authenticate users and manage their passwords. The file is typically edited by the system administrator or root user.

To modify the hostname in the "/etc/pam.d/common-password" file, you will need to use a text editor with root privileges, such as "nano" or "vi". Here are the steps to do so:

Open a terminal window and log in as the root user or use the "sudo" command to gain root privileges.

Use the text editor of your choice to open the "/etc/pam.d/common-password" file. For example, you could use the following command to open the file with "nano":

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password
Use the editor to modify the hostname setting in the file. The hostname is typically set in a line that begins with "password requisite pam_cracklib.so". You can modify the line to include the desired hostname, such as:

ruby
Copy code
password requisite pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=8 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-2 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 reject_username enforce_for_root maxrepeat=3 reject_common_words enforce_for_users hostname=example.com
Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.

After modifying the "/etc/pam.d/common-password" file, you may need to restart the PAM service or reboot the system for the changes to take effect. It's also a good idea to test the changes by attempting to change a user's password to ensure that the hostname is being properly set.

- sudo Autentication 3 times and Error Msg

- sudo action archived
When you use "sudo" to execute a command, the command and its output are not automatically archived or saved by default. However, you can manually redirect the output of a command to a file for archiving or further processing.

For example, you could use the following command to save the output of a "sudo" command to a file:

lua
Copy code
sudo command-name > output-file.txt
This will execute "command-name" with administrative privileges and redirect the output to "output-file.txt". You can then use the contents of "output-file.txt" for archiving or further analysis.

- TTY1
Refers to the first virtual terminal, which is a text-based console that allows users to interact with the system through a command-line interface. When you start up Debian, the system will usually automatically open a graphical interface, such as GNOME or KDE. However, you can switch to the tty1 console by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+Alt+F1".

Once you switch to tty1, you will be presented with a login prompt where you can enter your username and password to log in to the system. After logging in, you will have access to the command-line interface, where you can use commands to interact with the system, run programs, and manage files and directories.

The tty1 console can be useful for troubleshooting system issues, running scripts or programs that don't require a graphical interface, or for users who prefer the command-line interface. Additionally, switching to other tty consoles (such as tty2, tty3, etc.) can be helpful for multitasking or running multiple sessions simultaneously.

- 10/10 min script

- sudo restrict
To restrict the paths that can be used by sudo, you can modify the sudoers file using the visudo command. Here are the steps to implement the path restriction:

Open the sudoers file using the visudo command:
Copy code
sudo visudo
Scroll down to the line that starts with "Defaults secure_path". If this line is commented out, remove the "#" symbol at the beginning of the line to uncomment it. If the line is not present, add it to the end of the file.

Modify the secure_path variable to include the paths that you want to allow for sudo. For example, to allow the paths "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin", modify the line to look like this:

python
Copy code
Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
Save the changes to the sudoers file and exit the text editor.
After making these changes, the paths that are allowed for sudo will be restricted to the ones specified in the secure_path variable. This can help improve the security of your system by limiting the commands that can be run with elevated privileges.


- password
To set up a strong password policy, you can follow these steps:

Edit the password aging configuration file /etc/login.defs and set the following parameters:
Copy code
PASS_MAX_DAYS 30
PASS_MIN_DAYS 2
PASS_WARN_AGE 7
This will ensure that users are forced to change their passwords every 30 days, cannot change their passwords within 2 days of the last change, and receive a warning message 7 days before their password expires.

Install the cracklib-runtime package to enable password complexity checks.

Edit the PAM configuration file /etc/pam.d/common-password and add or modify the following line:

ruby
Copy code
password requisite pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=10 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 difok=3
This will enforce password complexity by requiring the password to be at least 10 characters long, contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number, and not contain more than 3 consecutive identical characters.

To prevent users from using their username as part of their password, you can edit the PAM configuration file /etc/pam.d/common-password and add the following line:
Copy code
password requisite pam_deny.so userdnam
To enforce the rule that the password must have at least 7 characters that are not part of the former password, you can install the libpam-pwquality package and edit the PAM configuration file /etc/pam.d/common-password to include the following line:
ruby
Copy code
password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=7 difok=7
This will ensure that the new password has at least 7 characters that are not part of the previous password.

Finally, make sure to configure SSH properly by disabling root login and configuring a strong password for the new user account that you create. You can also enable firewall to ensure secure access

- sudo error autentication
To implement the requirements for a strong sudo configuration, you can follow the steps below:

Open the sudo configuration file using the command sudo visudo

Add the following line to set the maximum number of password attempts to 3:

Defaults passwd_tries=3

Add the following line to display a custom error message:

Defaults badpass_message="Custom error message"

Replace "Custom error message" with the message of your choice.

Add the following line to enable sudo logging:

Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"

Create the directory to store the sudo log file:

sudo mkdir /var/log/sudo

Change the ownership and permissions of the sudo log directory:

sudo chown root:adm /var/log/sudo

sudo chmod 750 /var/log/sudo

Save and exit the sudo configuration file.

After completing these steps, the sudo group will be configured to limit password attempts, display custom error messages, and log all sudo activities to the specified log file.
